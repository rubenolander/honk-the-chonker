# Code Review

1. `script.js:58-80` - a small bug: some times the bottom cat seems to lag or not detect a change in the wheel variables sometimes. it chould be a ishue on my end.
1. `style.css:17-28` - the body and html tags dont need a min height and height of 100%, the body having a height of 100% should be enough.
1. `index.html:29-47` - the empty sreset in the img tags are not needed as they are empty.
1. `script.js:2` - the CHONKER variable should be lowercase to follow the rest of the nameing scheem.
1. `index.html,script.js,mediaquery.css,style.css:at the bottom` - there is one extra empty line at the bottom of all the files. this may be something that prettier does and is not a large ishue.
